qtxmlpatterns-opensource-src (5.0.2-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * Export QT_SELECT=qt5 to avoid a FTBFS when the debhelper patch that makes
    Qt4 as default get included.
    - Remove qt5-default as B-D, as it's not really needed now.
  * Confirm symbols for i386, ia64 and powerpc.
